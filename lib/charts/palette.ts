/**
 * The chart mark system in one place: the categorical palette, the rule that binds a color to
 * an entity, and the strokes, gaps and ink tones every option builder consumes. No builder
 * writes a hex of its own, so the day the brand moves this file is the only edit.
 *
 * **The order of the slots IS the safety mechanism, not a preference.** The eight hexes were
 * picked as a sequence: slots 1–3 stay apart under deuteranopia and protanopia, and every
 * further slot was chosen against all the previous ones. A chart of four colors is safe
 * *because* it uses the first four. Re-sorting them, or letting a view reach for slot 6 before
 * slot 2, throws that away — which is why `colorForEntity` is the only way in.
 *
 * **Slot 1 is not `--color-brand`.** The navy `#1e3a5f` sits below the luminance band a
 * categorical palette needs: against the white `surface` it reads as text rather than as a
 * fill, and keeping the other slots separable from it would drag the whole band dark. Slot 1
 * is a lighter step of that same family, so a chart still reads as the brand.
 *
 * The literal hexes below mirror `app/globals.css`'s `@theme` on purpose: an ECharts option is
 * a plain object handed to a canvas/SVG renderer, so it cannot consume a Tailwind utility.
 * This is the single mirror point.
