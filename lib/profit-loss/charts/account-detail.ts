/**
 * The model behind the account ficha: one `Series` in, the numbers that answer "how did this
 * account behave?" out. Pure, like `waterfall.ts`, so every rule below is a Vitest case rather
 * than something to eyeball in a panel.
 *
 * The rule the whole file rests on is the engine's, not a new one: a `null` point is a period
 * the SOURCE never reported and a `0` is a real accounting zero. So `2 de 7` reads "the account
 * moved in two of the seven months the file covers" — not two of twelve, and not two of the
 * months this one account happened to touch. Nothing here turns a `null` into a `0`.
 *
 * Every metric that cannot be computed comes back as `null` — never as `0`, and never as a
 * pre-formatted "—". A zero and a "does not apply" are different answers, and the panel is what
 * decides how the second one looks.
