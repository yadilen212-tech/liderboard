/**
 * The bridge between the workspace the user navigates and the sources the analytics engine
 * consumes. It is deliberately thin — every derivation stays in `buildAnalyticsSource` — and
 * pure, so the one decision it does make can be tested.
 *
 * That decision: **the identity of a source is the VIEW's, not the dataset's.**
 * `buildAnalyticsSource` falls back to `dataset.centerId ?? "default"`, which is right for a
 * lone dataset but not for what the user picks on screen. The Consolidado is synthetic and has
 * no center of its own; a standalone statement (`role: "single"`) carries no `centerId` at
 * all. If the engine and the selector name the same center differently, a `SeriesKey` can no
 * longer be traced back to the tab that produced it — so the two names are reconciled here,
 * once.
 *
 * The pay-off is that the Consolidado becomes an ordinary source: "Consolidado against Cultura
 * Manor" is a plain two-center query, with no special case anywhere downstream.
